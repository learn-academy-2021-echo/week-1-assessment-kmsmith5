# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer:

  Git is a program created to track the progress and timelines of projects and code. GitHub is the website where Git projects can be viewed and accessed.

  Researched answer:

  Git can be used to track ANY type of files, but is usually used by software developers to track versions of source code. Git saves changes as snapshots as opposed to a list of changes.

  Github makes using git easier by storing repositories of code that can be shared.



2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:

comparative statements, with =, <, >, <=, or >=  

  Researched answer:

You'll receive a boolean as the result of any evaluation that compares two pieces of data that are the same type. The result will either be true or false.


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:

  An index is the number that designates a position in a string or array.

  The value is the data that is stored at a given index or variable.

  Researched answer:

Index property is read-only. The first index of an array or string is 0. The last index of an array or string is the value of the length minus 1.


4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is repeating a specific action a designated number of times or while certain conditions are being met.

  Researched answer:

Iteration allows you to execute a function many times while using different data/input each time.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: There should be a driver and a navigator. The driver should be typing while the navigator should be describing what to type. Both members of the pair should have input in terms of problem solving.
